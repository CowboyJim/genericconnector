<h2>
Global Data Consistency, Microservices and Spring Boot
</h2>

You will often build services which need to make several calls to several (micro-) services, or write to a database and call a microservice.  But what happens if there is an 
error during a call to one of the services, or if the database commit fails, after you have called a service?  If a service call ends up writing data, you could end up with 
a globally inconsistent state.  You will need to compensate for that, and typically that compensation is something that is hand written and complex.<br/>
<br/>
In a 
<a href='http://blog.maxant.co.uk/pebble/2015/08/04/1438716480000.html' target='_blank'>recent article</a>
I wrote about how I have built a generic JCA connector which allows you to bind things like calls to microservices into global distributed transactions under the control
of Java EE application servers, precisely so that you don't have to write your own framework code for handling failures during distributed transactions.  The connector takes
care of ensuring that your data is eventually consistent.<br/>
<br/>
I have now extended the library to include automatic handling of commit / rollback / recovery into <b>Tomcat</b> or <b>Spring Boot</b> applications.<br/>
<br/>
Arun Gupta of Red Hat writes about different microservice patterns in the
<a href='https://dzone.com/servlet/storage/?file=293353' target='_blank'>DZone Getting Started with Microservices Refcard</a>.
Indeed the majority of those patterns show a microservice calling multiple other microservices. In all these cases, global data consistency becomes relevant, i.e. ensuring
that failure in one of the latter calls to a microservice is either compensated, or the commital of the call is re-attempted, until all the data in all the microservices 
is again consistent.
<br/>
<br/>
The first step in making sure your data remains eventually consistent is to add a transaction manager to your service.  If you are writing a composite microservice, then the
JVM in which it runs needs to have a transaction manager.  I have chosen to use

Here are some links for Getting Bitronix to work with Spring, Spring Boot or 
Tomcat is mostly a matter of ocnfiguration, for example

#genericconnector Demo - Common

This project contains generated code for the web service clients. Each demo uses these classes to make remote calls to the three web services which must be deployed in order for the demos to work.  The web service client code is generated by `wsimport` when maven executes the `generate-sources` phase. **Note** that if you are using an IDE like Eclipse you may need to run that phase and then add `target/generated/cxf/` as a source folder.

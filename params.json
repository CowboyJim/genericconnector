{"name":"Genericconnector","tagline":"JCA Resource Adapter for generic connections, like web services. ","body":"#genericconnector - Home\r\n\r\nA generic JCA resource adapter capable of binding things like web services into JTA global transactions controlled by Java EE application servers.\r\n\r\nSee details at http://blog.maxant.co.uk/pebble/2015/TODO\r\n\r\nUnlike WS-AT the idea is that the resources being integrated, like web services, have business operations for **executing** business logic and then **committing** or **rolling** back the business logic.  If the web service you want to integrate has no commit operation, because for example the execution already commits, then simply leave the implementation of the commit callback empty (see usage).  Transactions will be eventually consistent.\r\n\r\nCompatible with Java EE 6 (JCA 1.5) upwards and Java SE 1.6 upwards.\r\nTested on JBoss EAP 6.2, Wildfly 8.2 and Wildfly 9.0.\r\n\r\nSee connector/README.md for more details.\r\n\r\nThis folder contains:\r\n- the \"connector\" folder, containing the resource adapter\r\n- the \"demo\" folder containing a demo project showing how to use the adapter\r\n\r\n##License\r\n\r\n Copyright 2015 Ant Kutschera\r\n\r\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n   limitations under the License.\r\n","google":"UA-65233593-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
